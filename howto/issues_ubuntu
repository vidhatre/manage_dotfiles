1.axdev-triton had problems with apt-get 
  complained about ldpa-driver make wasn't working

  bala fixed it using:
  $ sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
  $ sudo dpkg  --configure -a

2. Was having issues with monitor resolution after crashes from nvidia drivers. on ubuntu 16.04LTS
    On a discovery of the HWE where ubuntuLTS has track where they package the newer kernel and 
    Xserver. Switching to this fixed my issues.
