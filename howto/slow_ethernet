#Slow downloads on ethernet. Needed to disable ipv6.

You might want to disable it right from the boot. For this purpose, open /etc/default/grub with your favorite text editor with root access (maybe sudo gedit /etc/default/grub.

In this file, find this line:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

and change it to:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 quiet splash"

Save the file and update grub by running:

sudo update-grub

You can disable in your current session using the following commands
