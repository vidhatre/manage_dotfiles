1. To install PyCharm using umake, you need to have umake first. Normally, it
   should already be installed in your system, but if it is not, use the PPA
   below to get the latest stable version of umake:

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-make
  
2a. Once you have umake, use the command below to install PyCharm Community Edition in Ubuntu:

  $ umake ide pycharm

(skip)2b. To install PyCharm Professional Edition (you need license for this), you can use the command below:

  $ umake ide pycharm-professional

4. To remove PyCharm installed via umake, use the command below:

$ umake -r ide pycharm
