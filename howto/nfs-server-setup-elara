2) setup our log repository. this is a pretty important task. the log repository machine is called axdev-elara. 
you can use jenkins username to log into it. this machine has about 40TB of storage. 
the basic idea is to define logs/ and data/ directories in this file system so that every other machine can see it. 
For this you need to setup NFS in all the machines. 

I believe the DELL guy exported the filesystem (John thinks the command is exportfs or something like that). 
But you need to make sure this setting is going to be there every time we restart this server or any other machine. 
so you need to put it in fstab (I guess). The best way is to test is with one machine (it can be your own machine) 
and then do the same for others. One important thing is to define different levels of access to 
different directories: all access, group access, and individual access.

Notes:
For Server(axdev-elara):
  $dpkg -l | grep nfs-kernel-server
  $apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

  Directories to be shared should be in /export/
  but the directories in /export should be bind mounted from there original location
    $mount --bind /home/users /export/users
  To save us from retyping this after every reboot we add the following
  line to /etc/fstab (whatever is in '')
    '/home/users    /export/users   none    bind  0  0'


sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo mkdir -p /usr/remote/share/{logs,data,workspace}
echo "192.168.0.30:/export/logs   /usr/remote/share/logs   nfs    auto  0  0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "192.168.0.30:/export/data   /usr/remote/share/data   nfs    auto  0  0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "192.168.0.30:/export/workspace   /usr/remote/share/workspace   nfs    auto  0  0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
sudo mount -a
echo $HOSTNAME >> /usr/remote/share/logs/test 
cat !$

echo "output" | sudo tee -a file
