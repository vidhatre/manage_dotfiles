Want to get remote acess via VNC setup. 
Ubuntu has an issue with encryption. So we will need to turn it off

(Assumption: You are on Ubuntu 16.04)

Steps:
1) open system app "Desktop Sharing"
   activate settings:
   -Sharing:
     Allow other users to view your desktop
     Allow other users to control your desktop
   -Security
     Require the user to enter this password: *****

   Then close

2) Install Dconf-editor:
   -run in terminal:
     sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
   
   -Open system app "dconf Editor"
     -In the sidebar navigate to:
       org > gnome > desktop > remote-access
     -Uncheck "require-encryption"
      (! might have to do this again on system restart)

3) On remote machine:
   -Copy ip address from hamachi 
   -Enter into VNC client
   -Type in password from step 1 > security

Note: 
- If you are not able to interact with the session double check the 
  option from STEP.1 "Allow other users to control your desktop"
  should be checked.

- If was working. and suddenly stopped working redo STEP.2
