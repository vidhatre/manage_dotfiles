1.axdev-triton had problems with apt-get 
  complained about ldpa-driver make wasn't working

  bala fixed it using:
  $ sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
  $ sudo dpkg  --configure -a

2. Was having issues with monitor resolution after crashes from nvidia drivers. on ubuntu 16.04LTS
    On a discovery of the HWE where ubuntuLTS has track where they package the newer kernel and 
    Xserver. Switching to this fixed my issues. 

    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack#Ubuntu_16.04_LTS_-_Xenial_Xerus
   
    DESKTOP
     sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-16.04 xserver-xorg-hwe-16.04

3. multiple shortcuts for media controls because windows keyboard
   settings > keyboard > shortcuts > custom > +
   Note that command is an actual shell command 
   so for media stuff piggy backing on current shortcut keys
   command "xdotool key --clearmodifiers XF86AudioNext"

4. microsoft ergo keyboard 4000, activate scroll thing
  
   url: https://askubuntu.com/a/702761
     I have successfully used approach similar to the previous ones 
       - instructions were mentioned in /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb.
   
     I've created new hwdb file using sudo nano /etc/udev/hwdb.d/70-keyboard.hwdb containing:
     
       # Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 - remap zoom in/out to page up/down
       evdev:input:b0003v045Ep00DB*
        KEYBOARD_KEY_c022d=pageup
        KEYBOARD_KEY_c022e=pagedown
     NOTE: you can set to scrollup and scrolldown as well.

     after that in terminal:
     
       sudo udevadm hwdb --update
       sudo udevadm control --reload
