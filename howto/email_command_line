1. Install all necessary packages:

    $ sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules nano
    Postfix configuration wizard will ask you some questions. Just select your 
    server as Internet Site and for FQDN use something like mail.your_domain.com
    
2. Then open your postfix config file:

    $ nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
    add/modify the following lines:

    relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
    smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
    smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
    smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
    smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
    smtp_use_tls = yes

3. Validate Certificate & Open/Create sasl_passwd:

   $ cat /etc/ssl/certs/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.pem | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/cacert.pem 
   $ sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd

4. And add following line:

    [smtp.gmail.com]:587 USERNAME@gmail.com:PASSWORD

  If you want to use your Google Appâ€™s domain, replace @gmail.com with your @domain.com.
  Also for PASSWORD use Google App password if you have enabled 2-Step-Verification.

5. Set sasl_passwd file permission and update postfix config to use sasl_passwd file:

    $ sudo chmod 400 /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
    $ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd

6. Reload postfix config for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/postfix reload

7. Testing:
   If you have configured everything correctly, following command should generate a 
   test mail from your server to your mailbox. Replace you@example.com with your email address.

    $ echo "Test mail from postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" you@example.com

   Other Notes:
   This will work with any mail server that provides SMTP relaying.

8. How to send attachments. 
   mailutils version of mail has the -A option
   bsd-mailx version of mail you need to manually do the encoding, look at below link on how to use uuencode.
   https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-send-mails-with-attachments-using-the-solaris-mailx-command/

9. Troubleshooting:
  Monitor postfix mail log in a separate session with the following command:

    $ tail -f /var/log/maillog

  If you receive the following error in your maillog file:

    postfix/smtp[3191]: AAC325FA46: SASL authentication failed; server smtp.gmail.com[64.233.166.108]

*(I did this since I already have 2-factor authentication enabled)
  If the error still persist turn on Google's 2-Step-Verification and Sign in using App Passwords to resolve the error.
