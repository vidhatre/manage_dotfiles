#Issues and fixes encountered while doing make Unified verilog

##Issue 1: 
## ** Error: (vsim-3033) ../../lib/fp_add.v(16): Instantiation of 'fp_add_0002' failed. The design unit was not found.
##Solution:
Since we are using IP from altera. The auto generated .vo file, "fp_add.vo", defines
module "fp_add" which should acutally be "fp_add_0002".
To Fix: append the 0002 to module name in .vo file

#Issue 2: # ** Error: (vsim-3063) ../../build/verilog/Top.v(4528): 
#Port 'io_out_bits_a' not found in the connected module (10th connection).
#Soln:
the last part of the name "_a" refers to the variable name in the output type of the module i had "a" as the variable in the gorilla code. But in the verilog it was q. changed the "_q" to "_a". this fixed my problem
