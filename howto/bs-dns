Hi All ,

I was able to setup DNS server on ganymede. But this version is static(no dhcp).
DHCP setting up with Netgear seems to not work and might take longer time. 


I want you guys with desktop or servers to do the following 
do ifconfig and find your ip address 
  add the following to your /etc/network/interfaces

  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.0.22
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-search linux.rocks
  dns-nameservers 192.168.0.43


  if you have existing eth0 or other ethernet interfaces - please remove them. Then run the following 

    sudo ifdown <interface>; sudo ifup <interface>

    you should be able to access axdev-shire, axdev-triton and axdev-ganymede so far
