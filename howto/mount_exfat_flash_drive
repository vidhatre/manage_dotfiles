# Ubuntu 16.04 didn't have the drivers required to open my exfat flash drive
# just install stuff with this command and then re-insert flash drive

$ sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils

#That command should make it such that you plug and work.
#if you need to manually mount though follwoing commands

$ sudo mkdir /media/exfat
$ sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdxx /media/exfat

#where /dev/sdxx could be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2, or so on.
#
#If you are not sure whether the exfat partition you are looking 
#for is /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2, then you could also run
$ sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL
